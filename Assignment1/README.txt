For question 3:
	run ./q3a_exe 	this will produce files in the OUTPUT directory (created in the makefile)
	run ./q3b_exe	this will produce an output to the console
	Files for part (a) are OUTPUT/.Q3Hilbert.txt and OUTPUT/.Q3Binomial.txt

For question 6: 
	run ./q6a_exe	this will produce files in the OUTPUT directory
	run ./q6b_exe	this will form the C matrix
	Files for part (a) are OUTPUT/.Q6UpperRight.txt, ... , OUTPUT/.Q6LowerLeft.txta

Running ``make clean'' will erase the executables and the OUTPUT directory.
